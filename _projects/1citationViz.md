This application, built using <a target="_blank" href="http://threejs.org/">three.js/webgl</a>, uses force-directed layout to visualize a complexly related dataset of scholarly articles. It uses multiple springs to represent multivariate edges. Users can then explore relationships among citation networks based on their own criteria. Users set rules of attraction/repulsion, and the papers rearrange in space to reflect those rules in real time. This allows the user to better understand the network and how papers and authors in it relate to each other. Ideally, users have some knowledge of the scholarly works in the corpus. This interface lets them see new clusters.
