This is a graphics project build with <a target="_blank" href="http://threejs.org/">three.js/webgl</a> depicting a spaceship battle. In it ships pursue each other through space according to flocking rules, leaving light trails and shooting rays at each other. I wrote a <a target="_blank" href="/2017/09/12/three-glow.html">blog post</a> about how I achieved efficient glow effects in the browser. This was part of a larger effort around optimization of glow effects to maximize frame rate and the number of objects on screen. Click the image to see it running in real-time.
