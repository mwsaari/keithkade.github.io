This project was built for a High School Computer Science teacher. It is a website meant to make the creation, assignment, and grading of homework easier for teachers and students. We used agile methodology and test-driven development. I was project owner. 
					
Students can write their code in the web browser (using the Ace code editor), submit it to the server (Ruby on Rails) for evaluation, and receive automated feedback on how their solution does. This is similar to sites such as HackerRank. Students can also complete quizzes using our software. Complimenting this is the admin view where the teacher can see the students progress and manage classes, students, and assignments. <a target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/165659747">Demo</a>.
