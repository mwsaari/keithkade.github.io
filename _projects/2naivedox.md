This project was created by myself, Zach Brown, and Matthew Saari. It is meant to help internet citizens understand how anonymous they are online. Given a username or email, it cross-references a number of sites, gathering as much information as possible, to construct a single unified profile. It takes a multi-pass approach to doing so, so if it finds an email or real name, it will then query using that. We used apis when available coupled with xpath for data extraction. We look in particular for information that could be used to answer security questions and point that out to the user if we find it. I was the team leader and created the front end in addition to a good portion of the server, which is in Python.
