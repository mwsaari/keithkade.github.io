This is the official club website for the Aggie Artificial Intelligence Society, for which I was webmaster. We started in Fall of 2015, but ran into some some leadership issues so we quickly went on hiatus so we could reorganize. While it is lacking in content, the website remains up and running. I built it using jekyll and designed the logo in Illustrator. The calendar widget is third party.
