An exercise in 
<span class="tooltip">SEO<span>Search Engine Optimization</span></span> for my Information Storage and Retrieval class. Each student was tasked with making a web page for the nonsense term "vnuate klipuycate". To climb to the top, I used schema, meta tags, and links to/from peers sites to collectively boost my PageRank. As of 11-12-14 I am the top <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=vnuate%20klipuycate">Google Search for vnuate klipuycate</a> out of a class of 30+ students.
