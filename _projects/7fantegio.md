This is a multiplayer web game based on the board game Stratego. I led a team consisting of myself, Matthew Saari, Richa Surbhi, and Ryan Ledbetter to make this. We used Create.js for graphics/animation and websockets for communication between clients/server. The server ran node.js. I created all of the graphics and wrote a good portion of the client-side javascript. The server was temporarily hosted by the university and is unfortunately no longer live, but we do have a gameplay <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_Y-zk_Jgrg">video</a>.
