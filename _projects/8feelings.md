I created this project with John Goen for my Information Storage and Retrieval class as well as the Yelp dataset challenge. In it, we conduct sentiment analysis on the review text of Yelp business reviews from the Yelp academic dataset. We do this in hopes of finding differences in the way people talk about businesses and the way people rate them. Our app allows users to sort by either the original rating or by sentiment (feels). We use Naive Bayes, which has been trained on a set of pre-classified documents to assign positivity scores to reviews. Based on the work of <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/llee/papers/cutsent.pdf">Pang and Lee</a>, we focus on the latter part of each review for determining sentiment. We then separate the scores into tiers to mirror the standard star ratings. Additionally, we filter out users that we deem not trustworthy based the ratings they give being different than the sentiment we perceive in their text.
