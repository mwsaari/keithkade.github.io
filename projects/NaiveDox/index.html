            It is meant to help internet citizens understand how anonymous they are online. A common perception among users on the Internet is that when they are not using their real name and instead use a “handle” or username that they made up, they are anonymous. This mindset is dangerous, as many internet users inadvertently reveal much more about themselves than they realize, leaving themselves to open to social engineering attacks. The process of looking up and releasing personally identifiable information about someone online is called "doxxing." 
        </p>
        <p>
            Our application automates that process. Given a username or email, it queries sites like Facebook, Twitter, Github, and Flickr and constructs a single unified profile for that username or email. Oftentimes, users inadvertantly de-anonymize themselves online by reusing a username accross different sites. 
        </p>
            
        <p>
            For example, someone might use the same username on Github and Facebook. They also list their email on Github because they want to provide contact info for their projects. That information can be exploited. Starting with just a reddit username, our application finds that user on Github, then takes that email and queries Facebook. Depending on a user's privacy settings, searching by email might return a link to their profile. And just like that, someone's Reddit comment history has been linked to their real name.

            Another weakness of many sites is that they use very simple security questions to validate users, such as "What is your mother's maiden name." In today's information age, questions like this could oftentimes be answered by someone other than the user they are meant to validate. Our application attempts to answer some of these by analyzing Reddit comments, tweets, and Facebook likes and family relationships. We do not try to get specific answers, but hope to show that a malicious human could social engineer answers to these questions using publically available information.

            Hopefully, our application will make users more aware of how much they are exposing themselves online. Shout out to <a href="http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/guofei/">Dr. Gu</a>, our professor, and <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">Github</a>, whose student developer pack provided the hosting for the code and the application.
